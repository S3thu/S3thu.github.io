# GRADIENT DECENT
## WHY GD?
- It is used for tuning best model parameters.
- Its main aim is to minimize the loss function and find best model parameters.

# Stochastic Gradient Decent
## WHY SGD?
- Uses randomly selected subset of the dat aat every step rather than the full dataset 
- similar to gradient decent.

### KEY WORDS
#### Model parameters
- These are the parameters in the model that must be determined using the training data set. These are the fitted parameters.
- Like WEIGHT and BIAS.
#### Loss Function
- A mathematical function that quantifies the difference between predicted and actual values in a machine learning model.
