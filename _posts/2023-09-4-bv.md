# Bias-Variance Tradeoff

## Bias
It is the training data error
## Variance
It is the test data error

## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

 - when we train less coomplex model it is prune to give high training error  and high testing error.
    * i.e high bias and high variance.
 - when we train more complex model it gives high accuracy during training but give high error during testing.
    * i.e low bias and high variance.
 - so we have to train a model that has low training error and low testing error.
    * i.e low bias and low variance.
