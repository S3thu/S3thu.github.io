# Hyper-Parameter
## WHAT ARE HYPER-PARAMETERS?
- Hyperparameters are external settings or configurations that are not learned from the data but are set by the data scientist or machine learning engineer.
- Like 
    * The lerning rate of model.
    * Number of Hidden Layers.
    * Number of trees in Decision Trees.
    * Regularization strength.

## WHY HYPER-PARAMETERS?
- Goal is to find hyper-parameters that result in the best model performance.

## How to get best Hyper-Parameters?
- Grid Search: Exhaustively searches through a predefined set of hyperparameter values, evaluating each combination.

- Random Search: Randomly samples hyperparameter values from predefined ranges, providing better exploration efficiency than grid search.

- K-Fold Cross-Validation: Splits the training data into K subsets, using each subset for validation while training the model on the remaining data, helping to assess hyperparameter performance robustly.
