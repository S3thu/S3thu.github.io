# Confusion Matrix
## WHY CONFUSION MATRIX ?
- It is used for evaluating models performance.

## Precision
- “Of all the positive predictions made by the model, how many were actually correct?”
## Recall or Sensitivity
-  “Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly predict?”
## Specificity
- “Of all the actual negative instances, how many did the model correctly predict as negative?”
## Accuracy
- It tells the accuracy
- It is the ratio of correct predictions (true positive and true negative) to the total number of instances.


### KEY WORDS
#### Type 1 Error
- Occur when we reject true null hypothesis.
- It is like making false prediction, suppose you dont have disease but your test results in you are having disease.

#### Type 2 Error
- Occurs when we fail to reject false null hypothesis.
- It is like making false predicting, suppose you have disease but your test result in you dont have disease.
